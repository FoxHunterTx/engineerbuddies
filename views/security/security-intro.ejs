        <h2>Computer Cyber Security - Introduction</h2>     
            <p>According to Wikipedia Cyber Security is:

‘Computer security, cyber security or information technology security (IT security) is the protection of computer systems and networks from the theft of or damage to their hardware, software, or electronic data, as well as from the disruption or misdirection of the services they provide.’
            </p>
            <p>
            In short, cyber threats are around us in any kind of form. Adversaries try to break into your system and/or device to steal any kind of data, to install malicious software (ransom-ware), to proof that they can work around your security measurements. 
            It does not matter what the purpose of the intruder is, it will be impacting the company or a person negatively. 
            Please do not think only on devices that are connected to the Internet but any device that communicates to other devices, for example via bluetooth and even car remote vehicle key.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Security teams, please notice:</strong>
              Security is treated as the fifth wheel on the car and when hacked we (the security team) are blamed for 
              security leak. It is a difficult approach for any security team to push the developers and other project
              team members in the right way without being pushy. Finding the ‘golden ’ middle is what we need to learn and to apply.
            </p>

            Thought about how to best approach this topic and came up with the below content . By no means that those 
            es describe the entire topics in full but it should be used as a guide.
